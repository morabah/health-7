# Completed Prompts

## Prompt 4.3: Connected Navbar to AuthContext & Implemented Role Navigation

- Enhanced the Navbar component to connect with AuthContext:

  - Shows loading spinner while authentication state is loading
  - Renders Login/Register buttons for logged-out users
  - Displays Find Doctors, Notifications, and role-specific dropdown for logged-in users
  - Shows correct navigation links based on user role (Patient/Doctor/Admin)
  - Implements proper logout functionality

- Key features implemented:

  - Role-aware navigation paths based on user profile type (PATIENT/DOCTOR/ADMIN)
  - Dynamic dashboard and profile links that route correctly for each user type
  - Loading indicator while authentication state is hydrating
  - Consistent UI between mobile and desktop versions
  - Preserved dark/light theme toggle functionality

- Files modified:
  - src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx - Connected with AuthContext and implemented role-based navigation

## Fixed Critical Errors (Prompt 4.3)

- Fixed metadata export in root layout

  - Split into client and server components to properly handle metadata export
  - Fixed imports in ClientLayout.tsx to use named exports

- Fixed TypeScript and linting errors
  - Updated AuthContext to make `__mockLogin` optional in window interface
  - Fixed UserType import in localApiFunctions.ts
  - Used string literals instead of enum references for userType values
  - Removed unused imports

These changes fixed the critical errors that were preventing the application from running properly.
