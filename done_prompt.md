**Error Handling Standardization Across Components**

- Created a comprehensive error handling utility library in `src/lib/errors/errorHandlingUtils.ts` with standardized patterns for:
  - Error message extraction from various error types (`extractErrorMessage`)  
  - Standardized error handling and logging (`handleError`)
  - Error categorization for UI display (`categorizeError`)
  - Error type conversion to proper AppError classes (`toAppError`)

- Improved error handling patterns in multiple components:
  - `/src/app/(platform)/patient/appointments/page.tsx`: Replaced generic error throws with specific error classes and proper logging
  - `/src/app/(platform)/doctor/appointments/page.tsx`: Implemented consistent error handling, better error messages and context
  - `/src/app/(platform)/patient/dashboard/page.tsx`: Standardized preference loading/saving error handling 

- Implemented consistent patterns for:
  - Using specialized error classes (AppError, ApiError, ValidationError, etc.)
  - Providing context with error logging
  - Consistent error message extraction
  - Properly categorizing errors for UI elements

**Checklist:**
- [x] Created error handling utilities library
- [x] Updated three key components with standardized patterns
- [x] Maintained type safety with proper error classes
- [x] Ensured consistent error logging format
- [x] Added proper error context to aid debugging

**Network Request Optimization: Prevent 308 Redirects**

- Fixed API URL formatting in `src/lib/localDb.ts` for all `/api/localDb` requests:
  - Ensured no trailing slash is present in the API endpoint.
  - Used `encodeURIComponent` for the `collection` query parameter.
- This prevents frequent 308 redirections (e.g., `/api/localDb?collection=users` → `/api/localDb/?collection=users`), reducing network latency for each API request.
- No changes to other files or logic were required.

**Checklist:**
- [x] Updated fetch calls in `localDb.ts` to use correct URL format.
- [x] Used `encodeURIComponent` for query parameter safety.
- [x] No trailing slash in endpoint.
- [x] Documented change in `done_prompt.md`.

**Verified PostCSS/Autoprefixer Integration and Ran Tailwind Build**

- Confirmed presence and correct configuration of `postcss.config.js` with both `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins enabled.
- Verified `autoprefixer` and `postcss` are present in `devDependencies` in `package.json`.
- Ran Tailwind CSS build with PostCSS (`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles/globals.css -o ./public/output.css --postcss`) to ensure autoprefixer is active and CSS output is properly prefixed for cross-browser compatibility.
- No changes to configuration were required; build completed successfully with no errors.

#### Next Steps:
- Continue to test the application in different browsers to confirm that vendor prefix issues are resolved.

**Implemented Recommended Fixes for Booking Appointment Workflow**

**Files Updated:**

- `/src/app/(platform)/book-appointment/[doctorId]/page.tsx`

**Details:**

- Standardized all appointment-related API responses to use `ApiResponse<T>` and specific endpoint types (e.g., `BookAppointmentResponse`).
- Enhanced cache invalidation: After a successful booking, invalidates React Query cache for appointments.
- Improved error handling: Added specific user feedback for slot unavailability, validation, and API errors. User is prompted to select another slot or correct details as needed.
- Ensured all booking API calls use `callApiWithOptions` and pass authentication context.
- Loading and transition states are visually indicated in the UI.
- Used Zod schemas for client-side validation of appointment data before submission. Field errors are mapped to the UI.
- Types/interfaces for payloads and responses are inferred from Zod schemas in `src/types/schemas.ts`.
- Added code comments for clarity and maintainability.

**Checklist:**

- [x] Standardized API response types
- [x] Enhanced cache invalidation
- [x] Improved error handling
- [x] Consistent API calls
- [x] Improved loading states
- [x] Data validation with Zod

### Step 761 & 769: Fix ReferenceError for BookAppointmentSchema, Improve Error Logging, and Ensure ISO Date Formatting

**Date:** 2025-05-10T12:54:01+03:00

#### What was done:

- **Fixed ReferenceError:**

  - Imported `BookAppointmentSchema` from `@/types/schemas` in `/src/app/(platform)/book-appointment/[doctorId]/page.tsx`.
  - This resolved the runtime ReferenceError that prevented form validation and submission.

- **Improved Error Logging:**

  - Enhanced the error logging in the booking form submission handler to always log error messages as strings and include stack traces when available.
  - This makes debugging issues like ReferenceError much easier and ensures logs are always actionable.

- **Ensured ISO Date Formatting:**
  - Confirmed that date strings sent to the slot availability API are formatted as full ISO 8601 datetime strings (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`), matching backend Zod schema expectations.

#### Files changed:

- `/src/app/(platform)/book-appointment/[doctorId]/page.tsx`
  - Added missing import for `BookAppointmentSchema`.
  - Patched error logging in the form submission handler.
  - Patched slot API date formatting.

#### Impact:

- Form submission no longer throws ReferenceError for missing schema.
- Error logs are now detailed and developer-friendly.
- Slot API calls now pass backend validation for date format.

#### Next Steps:

- Test booking flow end-to-end to ensure no further runtime errors.
- If new errors occur, logs will now provide clear details for rapid debugging.

- No changes to other files or logic were required.

**Checklist:**
- [x] Updated fetch calls in `localDb.ts` to use correct URL format.
- [x] Used `encodeURIComponent` for query parameter safety.
