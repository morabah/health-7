## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Storage Permission Errors**
```
Error: Firebase Storage: User does not have permission to access...
```
**Solution**: Verify storage rules are deployed with permissive settings

#### **File Upload Failures**
```
Error: storage/unknown or storage/unauthorized
```
**Solutions**:
1. Check Firebase Storage service is enabled
2. Verify storage rules allow uploads to `doctors/TEMP_REG_*` paths
3. Confirm Firebase configuration includes Storage

#### **Registration Function Errors**
```
Error: CORS or Function not found
```
**Solutions**:
1. Verify `registerUser` function is deployed
2. Check CORS configuration in Firebase Console
3. Confirm environment variables are correct

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Test storage permissions
npm run test:frontend:doctor-registration

# Validate frontend configuration
npm run validate:frontend:doctor-registration

# Check Firebase function deployment
firebase functions:list

# Verify storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage --dry-run
```
