## Prompt: TypeScript Type Safety Improvements

Improved type safety across the codebase by replacing all instances of `any` type with more specific types:

1. Fixed error handling in TypeScript:

   - In `serverLocalDb.ts`: Changed `catch (err: any)` to use `unknown` with proper type narrowing for better error handling
   - In `errorMonitoring.ts`: Changed console error args from `any[]` to `unknown[]` for safer type handling
   - In `firebaseErrorMapping.ts`: Fixed dynamic property access using `((standardError as unknown) as Record<string, unknown>)[key] = value` instead of `(standardError as any)[key]`

2. Fixed interface definitions:

   - In `errorMonitoring.ts`: Confirmed that `ErrorContext` interface correctly uses `[key: string]: unknown` instead of `any`
   - Added proper type assertion to fix a linter error in `reportError` function's return value

3. Made function parameters more type-safe:
   - Verified that `validateAuthContext` function uses a proper TypeScript interface
   - Verified that `validateGetAvailableSlotsPayload` uses a specific type definition
   - Confirmed that `updateMyUserProfile` uses `Record<string, unknown>` for type-safe dynamic property access

These changes improve type safety, provide better IDE support, and reduce the risk of runtime errors caused by incorrect type assumptions.

- Implemented both `formatDateForInput` and `formatDateForApi` functions
- Fixed date format warnings by ensuring ISO date strings are properly converted to the format expected by date inputs

## API Call Parameter Handling Fixes

### Fixed API Call Parameter Structure Issues

- Fixed the `useCompleteAppointment` hook in `doctorLoaders.ts` to properly separate authentication context from payload data
- Fixed the `useCancelAppointment` hook in `patientLoaders.ts` to correctly pass auth context as first parameter
- Fixed the `useAppointmentDetails` hook in `patientLoaders.ts` to include proper auth context
- These fixes resolved errors like "Cannot destructure property 'appointmentId' of 'payload' as it is undefined"
- All hooks now follow the pattern of passing auth context as the first argument and payload data as the second argument

The fixed structure ensures proper separation between authentication context and functional data:

```ts
// Correct pattern
return callApi(
  'functionName',
  { uid: user.uid, role: UserType.DOCTOR }, // Auth context as first arg
  { paramName: paramValue } // Payload as second arg
);
```

These fixes ensure consistent API call patterns across the application and resolve errors in appointment management functionality.

## Lint and Accessibility Fixes (2023-10-24)

We have addressed several critical linting and accessibility issues in the codebase, focusing on the most important files:

### What was fixed:

1. **Type safety improvements**:
   - Replaced `any` types with more specific types in `performanceMetrics.ts` and `bookingApi.ts`
   - Used `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `Record<string, any>`
   - Created custom types like `TrackedProps` for better type safety

2. **Accessibility enhancements**:
   - Fixed Modal component by adding proper aria attributes and fixing conditional hook issues
   - Improved NotificationPanel with keyboard navigation support and proper ARIA roles
   - Fixed form labels in TodoList component with proper for/id associations

3. **React hooks compliance**:
   - Fixed conditional hook calls
   - Ensured hooks are always called in the same order

4. **Unused code cleanup**:
   - Removed unused imports and variables in bookingApi.ts
   - Fixed implementation of dashboardCacheKey function

### Remaining issues to address:

1. **Unused variables and imports** (highest count):
   - Use the `--fix` flag with ESLint to automatically remove these where possible
   - For variables intentionally kept for future use, prefix with underscore (e.g., `_unusedVar`)
   - Update import statements to use type imports where appropriate

2. **Remaining `any` types** (high impact):
   - Focus on `optimizedDataAccess.ts` which has many `any` type occurrences
   - Create proper interfaces for data structures instead of using `any`
   - Use union types or unknown with type guards where the exact type cannot be determined

3. **Accessibility issues**:
   - Focus on form label associations in registration pages
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Add proper ARIA roles to custom UI components

4. **Module export style issues**:
   - Address the anonymous default export warnings in `apiErrorHandling.ts` and `firebaseErrorMapping.ts`
   - Assign the exported object to a named constant before exporting

5. **Fix require() style imports**:
   - Update `tailwind.config.js` to use ES module imports instead of require

These improvements have significantly reduced the number of lint errors in the project and improved both code quality and accessibility compliance. Continuing to address the remaining issues will further improve code quality and maintainability.

## Admin Dashboard Lint Fixes (2023-10-25)
