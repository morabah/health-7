## Prompt: Enhance Admin Doctors Page with URL Parameter Filtering

**Completed Changes:**

1. Enhanced `/admin/doctors` page with URL parameter support for status filtering
2. Added the ability to search doctors by name, email, and specialty
3. Improved data connectivity between admin dashboard and the local database
4. Updated `adminGetAllDoctors` function to join doctor and user data, ensuring admin pages display proper names and emails
