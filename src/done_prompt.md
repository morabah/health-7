- Data stored in the local database conforms to the Zod schema definitions
- Proper data transformation happens when retrieving and storing doctor information
- The verification process provides clear feedback to both admins and doctors

## Prompt: TypeScript Type Safety Improvements

Improved type safety across the codebase by replacing all instances of `any` type with more specific types:

1. Fixed error handling in TypeScript:

   - In `serverLocalDb.ts`: Changed `catch (err: any)` to use `unknown` with proper type narrowing for better error handling
   - In `errorMonitoring.ts`: Changed console error args from `any[]` to `unknown[]` for safer type handling
   - In `firebaseErrorMapping.ts`: Fixed dynamic property access using `((standardError as unknown) as Record<string, unknown>)[key] = value` instead of `(standardError as any)[key]`

2. Fixed interface definitions:

   - In `errorMonitoring.ts`: Confirmed that `ErrorContext` interface correctly uses `[key: string]: unknown` instead of `any`
   - Added proper type assertion to fix a linter error in `reportError` function's return value

3. Made function parameters more type-safe:
   - Verified that `validateAuthContext` function uses a proper TypeScript interface
   - Verified that `validateGetAvailableSlotsPayload` uses a specific type definition
   - Confirmed that `updateMyUserProfile` uses `Record<string, unknown>` for type-safe dynamic property access

These changes improve type safety, provide better IDE support, and reduce the risk of runtime errors caused by incorrect type assumptions.

## Prompt: Performance Optimization

**Completed Changes:**

1. **Enhanced React Query Caching:**

   - Improved the `queryClient` configuration with longer cache times (5-10 minutes)
   - Added a comprehensive `cacheKeys` system for consistent query key management
   - Created a `cacheManager` utility with functions for cache manipulation
   - Implemented intelligent cache invalidation for related entities

2. **Lazy Loading Components:**

   - Created `lazyLoadUtils.tsx` utility with several approaches to component lazy loading
   - Implemented the `lazyLoad` HOC for dynamic imports with configurable loading states
   - Added support for minimum loading display times to prevent UI flickering
   - Created a component prefetching system for improved user experience

3. **Optimized Database Access:**

   - Created `optimizedDataAccess.ts` with multi-level caching (React Query + in-memory)
   - Added time-based cache expiration (30s for most data, 15s for frequently changing data)
   - Implemented client-side filtering, sorting, and pagination for faster UI responses
   - Enhanced data access with proper TypeScript typing

4. **Enhanced API Client:**

   - Created `enhancedApiClient.ts` with React Query integration
   - Added type-safe hook factories (`useApiQuery`, `useApiMutation`) for common operations
   - Implemented automatic cache invalidation on mutations
   - Created domain-specific hooks for common operations (`useMyUserProfile`, `useAvailableSlots`, etc.)

5. **Implementation in Application:**

   - Updated `ClientLayout.tsx` to use the optimized QueryProvider from `queryClient.ts`
   - Enhanced `apiClient.ts` to use optimized data access methods when appropriate
   - Added lazy-loaded `LazyDoctorList` component to the patient dashboard
   - Implemented proper error handling for optimized data access with fallback to standard methods
   - Added placeholders and loading states for lazy-loaded components
   - Fixed TypeScript errors by adding proper type assertions and interfaces for API responses

6. **Fixed Build Issues:**
   - Cleaned up Next.js build cache to resolve module resolution errors
   - Fixed TypeScript errors and type assertions for response data
   - Added proper interfaces for API responses to ensure type safety
   - Updated dependency handling to resolve peer dependency conflicts

These optimizations significantly improve application performance by:

- Reducing the number of network requests through intelligent caching
- Decreasing initial load time through component lazy loading
- Improving data access efficiency through multi-level caching
- Creating a smoother user experience with optimistic UI updates and prefetching
- Ensuring type safety throughout the optimization implementation

# Prompt Completion Log

## Prompt: Fix type errors in localApiFunctions.ts to match Zod schemas

### What was done:

- Fixed all type errors in `src/lib/localApiFunctions.ts` to strictly match the Zod schemas in `src/types/schemas.ts`.
- Ensured all DoctorProfile and PatientProfile creation, updates, and mock data include all required fields (e.g., `id`, `rating`, `reviewCount`, etc.).
- Fixed admin doctor creation, public doctor profile, and weeklySchedule typing to match schema requirements.
- Updated backend data handling to strictly conform to Zod schemas and TypeScript types inferred from them.
- All linter errors in `src/lib/localApiFunctions.ts` resolved.
- Ran tests and confirmed all pass.
- Committed and pushed changes to GitHub with message:
  > Fix type errors in localApiFunctions.ts to match Zod schemas: ensure DoctorProfile and PatientProfile creation, updates, and mock data include all required fields (id, rating, reviewCount, etc). Fixes for admin doctor creation, public doctor profile, and weeklySchedule typing. All backend data now strictly conforms to src/types/schemas.ts. Linter errors resolved.

### Files affected:

- `src/lib/localApiFunctions.ts`

- No further action required for this prompt. If new features or fixes are needed, refer to this log for context.

## Optimization and Bug Fixes

### Patient Profile Update Fix

- Fixed the `useUpdatePatientProfile` hook in `patientLoaders.ts` to properly pass user context to the API
- The prior implementation incorrectly passed the data object in place of the context
- The fix ensures that profile updates properly reach the backend API and are saved

### SVG viewBox Error Fix

- Created a custom `Divider` component in `src/components/ui/Divider.tsx` that uses CSS borders instead of SVG
- Updated the patient dashboard to use the new Divider component
- This resolves the error: `Error: <svg> attribute viewBox: Expected number, "0 0 100% 4"`
- The new component is more accessible and performs better

### Date Format Handling Improvements

- Added utilities in `dateUtils.ts` for properly formatting dates between HTML inputs and APIs
- Implemented both `formatDateForInput` and `formatDateForApi` functions
- Fixed date format warnings by ensuring ISO date strings are properly converted to the format expected by date inputs

## API Call Parameter Handling Fixes

### Fixed API Call Parameter Structure Issues

- Fixed the `useCompleteAppointment` hook in `doctorLoaders.ts` to properly separate authentication context from payload data
- Fixed the `useCancelAppointment` hook in `patientLoaders.ts` to correctly pass auth context as first parameter
- Fixed the `useAppointmentDetails` hook in `patientLoaders.ts` to include proper auth context
- These fixes resolved errors like "Cannot destructure property 'appointmentId' of 'payload' as it is undefined"
- All hooks now follow the pattern of passing auth context as the first argument and payload data as the second argument

The fixed structure ensures proper separation between authentication context and functional data:

```ts
// Correct pattern
return callApi(
  'functionName',
  { uid: user.uid, role: UserType.DOCTOR }, // Auth context as first arg
  { paramName: paramValue } // Payload as second arg
);
```

These fixes ensure consistent API call patterns across the application and resolve errors in appointment management functionality.
